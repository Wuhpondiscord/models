# Aimbot Application

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of an open-source aimbot application using YOLO for object detection and the Mouse Anywhere library for mouse movement automation. It is intended as a learning tool to explore the integration of these technologies in a controlled and ethical environment. **This application is not intended for malicious use and should only be used responsibly.**

## Key Features
- **YOLO Integration:** Uses YOLO for real-time object detection and tracking.
- **Mouse Anywhere Integration:** Automates mouse movement for interacting with detected targets.
- **Customizable Settings:** Includes configurable options for detection thresholds, ignored classes, priorities, mouse speed, and more.
- **Safe for Experimentation:** Allows users to double-check the source code and dependencies to ensure safety.

## Transparency
Open-source aimbot tools are often met with skepticism due to potential malicious usage. To address these concerns:

1. **Mouse Anywhere Source:** The source code for the `mouse-anywhere` library can be found here:
   [https://github.com/wuhplaptop/mouse-anywhere](https://github.com/wuhplaptop/mouse-anywhere).

2. **YOLO Overlay Source:** The source code for the `yolo-overlay` library is available here:
   [https://github.com/wuhplaptop/yolo_overlay](https://github.com/wuhplaptop/yolo_overlay).

4. **VirusTotal Report:** The VirusTotal scan report for this application's compiled menu UI can be found here:

## Limitations
- This is a **basic example** and not a full-fledged or production-ready application.
- The project assumes users have some understanding of YOLO, Python, and computer vision concepts.
- Users are encouraged to review the code and dependencies thoroughly.

## Ethical Use
This application is provided for educational purposes and legitimate use cases, such as improving object detection and automation workflows. Please avoid using this software for activities that violate ethical guidelines or terms of service of any platform.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python dependencies.
3. Load a YOLO model and configure the settings through the app’s UI.
4. Start the application and experiment with its features.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the project’s features, performance, or usability are welcome! Ensure your contributions align with the project's intent of ethical and educational use.

Thank you for exploring this project responsibly!
